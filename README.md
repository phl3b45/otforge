A free, open-source ICS/SCADA cybersecurity training platform for researchers, educators, and students. Build realistic industrial control system environments on your laptop — no hardware, no subscription, no cost.

Developed by **Ian Burres**, Professor of Practice at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), in support of ICS/SCADA security education and research.

---

## What It Does

OTForge lets you design, deploy, and attack realistic ICS/SCADA environments using a visual drag-and-drop canvas. Each device in your scenario runs as a real Docker container on an isolated virtual network — protocol traffic is genuine, not simulated at the application layer.

**Author a scenario** → drag PLCs, RTUs, IEDs, sensors, and network devices onto the canvas, wire them with protocol edges, write IEC 61131-3 ladder logic, configure the firewall — then click **Run**. Docker Compose spins up the full environment in seconds.

**Attack the scenario** → launch the Kali Linux desktop (Wireshark, Metasploit, ICS-specific tools) in a dedicated OS window via KasmVNC and work through the mission.

**Monitor and analyze** → live Grafana dashboards show Suricata IPS alerts and Zeek protocol logs alongside the InfluxDB process historian.

## Features

### Visual Scenario Builder
- Drag-and-drop SCADA canvas with ISA-5.1 / IEC 81346 standard P&ID symbols
- **Six-zone Purdue Reference Model** network topology (IEC 62443-3-2 / NIST SP 800-82):
  - **OT (L0–L2)** — PLCs, RTUs, IEDs, sensors, actuators, field devices
  - **Control Center (L3)** — HMI, historian, engineering workstation, application/database servers
  - **Plant DMZ (L3.5)** — Firewall, IDS/IPS, router, switch
  - **Enterprise (L4)** — Domain controller, web/business servers, enterprise desktops
  - **Internet DMZ (L5)** — Email servers, internet-facing servers
  - **Red Team** — Kali Linux attack machine (isolated attacker network)
- Zone-aware firewall rule editor with nftables enforcement
- Self-healing IP assignment — the compose generator automatically resolves duplicate IPs on every simulation start
- Delete Scenario button — clears all devices with a confirmation prompt

## Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 22H2+ or Windows 11 23H2+, macOS 13+, Ubuntu 22.04+ |
| RAM | 8 GB (16 GB recommended for attack machine scenarios) |
| Disk | 20 GB free (Docker images downloaded on first run) |
| Docker Desktop | Latest stable |
| Node.js | 22+ (development only — Node 20 is EOL and incompatible with Vite 8) |

---

## Quick Start

### Run from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iburres/otforge.git
cd otforge
npm ci
npm run build:packages
npm run dev
```

Docker Desktop must be running before launching the app.

> **Node.js 22+ required.** Vite 8 uses `crypto.hash()`, which was added in Node 21.7. Node 20 will throw `TypeError: crypto.hash is not a function`.

**First-time students:** see [`docs/student-setup.md`](docs/student-setup.md) (also available as [`docs/student-setup.html`](docs/student-setup.html)) for a full step-by-step walkthrough covering Docker, Git, Node.js, and OTForge setup on both Windows and macOS.

### Build a distributable

```bash
# Windows
npm run build:win

# macOS
npm run build:mac

# Linux
npm run build:linux
```

## Network Architecture

Each scenario runs six isolated Docker bridge networks matching the Purdue Reference Model:

| Zone | Network | Subnet | Devices |
|---|---|---|---|
| OT (L0–L2) | `ot-net` | 10.200.10.0/24 | PLC, RTU, IED, sensor, actuator, pump, valve, flow meter, pressure transmitter |
| Control Center (L3) | `control-net` | 10.200.20.0/24 | HMI, historian, engineering workstation, application server, database server |
| Plant DMZ (L3.5) | `plant-dmz-net` | 10.200.30.0/24 | Firewall, IDS/IPS, router, switch |
| Enterprise (L4) | `enterprise-net` | 10.200.40.0/24 | Domain controller, web server, business server, enterprise desktop |
| Internet DMZ (L5) | `internet-dmz-net` | 10.200.50.0/24 | Email server, internet server |
| Red Team | `attacker-net` | 10.200.60.0/24 | Kali Linux attack machine |

System services (InfluxDB, Loki, Grafana, FUXA, Promtail) occupy `.240`–`.249` in their respective zone; user devices start at `.10` and increment automatically.

---

## Scenario Format

Scenarios are saved as `.otflab` JSON files with four layers:

```json
{
  "meta":     { "name": "Water Treatment Plant", "sector": "water", "version": "1.0" },
  "visual":   { "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] },
  "network":  { "segments": [...], "protocolEdges": [...] },
  "devices":  { "devices": { "plc-1": { ... }, "rtu-1": { ... } } },
  "security": { "firewallRules": [...], "idsConfig": { ... } }
}
```

Share your scenarios with the community — open a pull request against the [otforge-scenarios](https://github.com/iburres/otforge-scenarios) repository (coming soon).

### Community Scenario Packs (.otfpack)

Pack multiple scenarios, custom device types, and sector-specific detection rules into a single `.otfpack` ZIP:

```
pack.json                    — manifest (id, name, version, author, sector, ...)
scenarios/                   — pre-built .otflab scenario files
devices/
  registry.json              — custom device types (label + Docker image override)
  icons/                     — SVG icons displayed in the palette
rules/
  suricata/                  — .rules files (Emerging Threats format)
  zeek/                      — .zeek protocol analysis scripts
```

Install packs via **Toolbar → Packs → Install Pack** (Author mode). Installed packs appear in the Pack Manager where you can open bundled scenarios or uninstall packs. Custom device types from packs appear in the palette under **Pack Devices**, draggable onto the canvas like any built-in device.
